## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Standards
- **Code Quality**: All code must pass linting, formatting, and static analysis
- **Testing**: Each task must include appropriate unit/widget tests
- **Accessibility**: All UI components must meet WCAG AA standards
- **Internationalization**: No hardcoded strings, all text must be localized

### Definition of Done
- Feature implemented according to requirements
- Unit/widget tests written and passing
- Accessibility requirements verified
- Tested on target platforms (iOS/Android/Web)

### Task Execution Order
Tasks are designed to build incrementally. Start with task 1 (Project Foundation) and proceed sequentially. Each task builds upon the previous ones, ensuring a solid foundation before adding complex features.

### Key Dependencies
- Tasks 1-3: Foundation (project setup, design system, i18n)
- Tasks 4-6: Authentication and user management
- Tasks 7-9: Core event functionality
- Tasks 10-11: Map integration
- Tasks 12-13: RSVP system
- Tasks 14-17: Additional features (groups, venues, calendar)
